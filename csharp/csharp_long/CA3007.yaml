  message: |
    Potentially untrusted HTTP request input reaches an HTTP response redirect.
    Some approaches to fixing open redirect vulnerabilities include:
    - Don't allow users to initiate redirects.
    - Don't allow users to specify any part of the URL in a redirect scenario.
    - Restrict redirects to a predefined "allow list" of URLs.
    - Validate redirect URLs.
    - If applicable, consider using a disclaimer page when users are being redirected away from your site.
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        string $INPUT = $REQUEST.$PARAMS[$USER_CONTROLLED];
        ...
        $HTTPRESPONSE.Redirect($INPUT);
