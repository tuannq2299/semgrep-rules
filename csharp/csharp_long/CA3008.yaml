    Potentially untrusted HTTP request input reaches an XPath query.
    Some approaches to fixing XPath injection vulnerabilities include:
    - Don't construct XPath queries from user input.
    - Validate that the input only contains a safe set of characters.
    - Escape quotation marks.
  patterns:
    - pattern-inside: using System.Xml.XPath; ...
    - pattern-either:
      - pattern: |
          XPathNavigator $NODE = AuthorizedOperations.SelectSingleNode(... + $INPUT + ...);
      - pattern: |
          XPathNavigator $NODE = AuthorizedOperations.SelectSingleNode($QUERY);
