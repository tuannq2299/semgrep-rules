  message: |
    Encryption algorithms such as TripleDES and hashing algorithms such as SHA1 and RIPEMD160 are considered to be weak.
    These cryptographic algorithms do not provide as much security assurance as more modern counterparts. 
    Cryptographic hashing algorithms SHA1 and RIPEMD160 provide less collision resistance than more modern hashing algorithms. 
    The encryption algorithm TripleDES provides fewer bits of security than more modern encryption algorithms.
    Use cryptographically stronger options:
      - For TripleDES encryption, use Aes encryption.
      - For SHA1 or RIPEMD160 hashing functions, use ones in the SHA-2 family (e.g. SHA512, SHA384, SHA256).
  patterns:
    - pattern-inside: |
        using System.Security.Cryptography;
        ...
    - pattern-either:
      - pattern: |
          var $VAR = SHA1.Create();      
      - pattern: |
          var $VAR = RIPEMD160Managed.Create();
      - pattern: |
          using (TripleDES $VAR = TripleDES.Create())
            {
              ...
            }
